The program reads from input.xml (same as file in assignment pdf)
It loads and saves orders in reservations.xml
It saves new users in input.xml

The program loads .jpg images from Dish Images folder

I pushed files with some orders saved so some tables will already be reserved when testing.

The .jar file works from the command prompt but I couldn't get it to work by double clicking.
